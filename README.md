# Encased Mods

### List of mods (projects in VS solution)

- Lifebelt [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/xxxx/mods/??? "link")

### Requirements
- Encased game extension [nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/44? "nexus")
- BepInEx [link](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases "BepInEx 6.x x64")
  (Bundled into Vortex extension)

### Build

#### Preparation:
- You have to set folders of your games (without ending '\\' sign) in solution directory, file: SolutionDirs.targets
- If you have own publicized Assembly files you can copy into folder: 
*[SolutionDir]\Dependencies*

### Installation
I recommend to use Vortex.
[Vortex Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/ "Vortex Download")

But of course you can copy the output DLL into folder GAME_INSTALL_FOLDER\BepInEx\plugins\
